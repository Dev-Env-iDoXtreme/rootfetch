Development Environment
-----------------------

Set up a Python 2.7 [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) with [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).

```console
$ # create a virtualenv and activate it
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs the dependencies for `rootfetch`, and installs rootfetch from the
local directory.
